# Name Entity Recognition Project 
NER project for AI course 50.021 @ SUTD

## Task Description
Our main task is to apply Named-entity recognition(NER) to a given NEWS sentence. NER is a subtask of information extraction which concerns the processing of human language texts by Natural Language Processing(NLP) methods. The aim of NER is to locate and classify named entities mentioned in various unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as names, organizations, quantities, monetary values, etc.

## Models
- Bi-LSTM
- BERT with pretrained
- 3 layer BERT without pretrained 

## Result Discussion
- 3 layer BERT without pretrained perform best among all three models with its high F1 score.

## How to use
We have a GUI ready with trained nn. To predict the NER labels, just type in the text box and click predict button.
